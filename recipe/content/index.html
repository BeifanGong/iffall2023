    <h1>Braised Pork Belly recipe</h1>
    <h4>Red braised pork belly or hong shao rou (simplified Chinese: 红烧肉; traditional Chinese: 紅燒肉; pinyin: hóngshāoròu) is a classic pork dish from China, red-cooked using pork belly and a combination of ginger, garlic, aromatic spices, chilies, sugar, star anise, light and dark soy sauce, and rice wine. The pork belly is cooked until the fat and skin are gelatinous, soft, and melt easily in the mouth, while the sauce is usually thick, sweet and fairly sticky.</h4>

    <h2>Reviews</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><i>It has a perfectly balanced sweet and savory flavor. The texture of the slow-cooked pork is soft and could almost melt in your mouth. My mouth is literally watering as I am writing about this dish right now. --- Spice the Plate</i></li>
        <li><i>Pork belly has a rich, savory flavor with a slightly sweet and slightly salty taste. It has a high-fat content, which gives it a rich, succulent flavor when it is cooked. --- Toast Tab</i></li>
        <li><i>The dish has a melt-in-the-mouth texture that is formed as a result of a long braising process, during which the liquid reduces and becomes thick. --- Wikipedia</i></li>
        <li><i>Imagine a perfectly moist bite of pork that's wrapped in a saltier crunch. That's pork belly! --- Grassland Beef</i></li>
        <li><i>With its crisp, crunchy skin and tender meat that melts in the mouth, pork belly is stunning when treated with a bit of care and attention. The fact that it's also incredibly versatile and affordable just adds to its charm. --- Fresh'et International Ltd</i></li>
        <li><i>Because slow cooking allows the flavourful fat to render down, which over time, becomes absorbed into the meat leaving you with melt-in-your-mouth-tender meat. --- Swiss Farm</i></li>
        <li><i>Pork belly is essentially “better bacon”. It has more meat, more healthy fat, and greater culinary complexity. --- Grassland Beef </i></li>
        <li><i>As a delicacy for all ages, Red Braised Pork is also rich in collagen and good for maintaining beauty, keeping young and improving the elasticity of skin. --- Yum Chinese Food</i></li>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>12 ounces pork belly</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons oil</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon rock sugar</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons Shaoxing wine</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon soy sauce</li>
        <li>1/2 tablespoon dark soy sauce</li>
        <li>2 cups water</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Cut the pork belly into 3/4 inch thick pieces.</li>
        <li>Then bring a pot of water to a boil. Blanch the pork for a couple minutes. This gets rid of impurities and starts the cooking process. Take the pork out of the pot and set aside.</li>
        <li>Over low heat, add oil and sugar to your wok. Melt the  sugar slightly and add the pork. Raise the heat to medium and cook until the pork is lightly browned.</li>
        <li>Turn the heat back down to low and add Shaoxing cooking wine, regular soy sauce, dark soy sauce, and water.</li>
        <li>Cover and simmer over medium heat for about 45 minutes to 1 hour until pork is fork tender.</li>
        <li>And then, it's time to eat!</li>
        <li>Leftovers are not recommended to be kept for more than 1 day. Keep them refridgerated and warm them before eating again.</li>

            <p>This is an installation manual for bikes. I like its clear document design because it uses levels of headings to indicate each step.
