    <h3>Name, Major, Year in school</h3>
    <p>Jeffrey Gong, Computer Science + Human-Computer Interaction, Junior</p>
    <h3>Background</h3>
    <p>I am a future software engineer with experiences in mobile app development and web development. While many other web development courses teach web frameworks and architecture, this course could help me make prettier websites with more detailed explanation in CSS.</p>
    <h3>Experience</h3>
    <p>I have taken CSE330S, which focuses mostly on web development cycle such as server-side back-end technnologies including PHP, Python and front-end frameworks including React. But it also introduces a little bit regarding HTML/CSS/Javascript.</p>
    <h3>Thing to learn</h3>
    <p>I hope to learn more about CSS principles and common attributes to make my websites look nicer.</p>
    <h3>Difference in designing on screen</h3>
    <p>One benefit of designing on a screen I could think of is that it allows for mistakes to happen. For example, if we made a typo somewhere, we could easily fix it by changing a few lines of code. While on paper, fixing a mistake could potentially be complicated. </p>
    <h3>Effective Design Website</h3>
    <a href="https://www.zillow.com/">Zillow</a> This website provides clear navigation for renters and buyers to search for houses they want. They could easily set filters to identify properties that satisfy their requirements.
    <h3>Effective Communication Website</h3>
    <a href="https://www.palantir.com/">Palantir</a> This website successfully commnucates the purpose of the company by providing examples of their products.
    <h3>Website that works well</h3>
    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/">Amazon</a> This website provides a clear search box where users could use to find items they want to purchase. When users just want to browse without a item in mind, they could just simply navigate to the categories page to see a list of items they might be interested in.
