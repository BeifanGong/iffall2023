        <h1>I See Fire</h1>
        <em>Ed Sheeran</em>
        <h3 class="first-paragraph">[Intro]</h3>
        <p>
            Oh, misty eye of the mountain below
            <br>
            Keep careful watch of my brothers' souls
            <br>
            And should the sky be filled with fire and smoke
            <br>
            Keep watching over Durin's sons
        </p>
        <hr>
        <h3>[Verse 1]</h3>
        <p>
            If this is to end in fire
            <br>
            Then we should all burn together
            <br>
            Watch the flames climb high into the night
        </p>
        <p>
            Calling out father oh
            <br>
            Stand by and we will
            <br>
            Watch the flames burn auburn on
            <br>
            The mountain side (high)
        </p>
        <hr>
        <h3>[Verse 2]</h3>
        <p>
            And if we should die tonight
            <br>
            Then we should all die together
            <br>
            Raise a glass of wine for the last time
        </p>
        <p>
            Calling out father oh
            <br>
            Prepare as we will
            <br>
            Watch the flames burn auburn on
            <br>
            The mountain side
            <br>
            Desolation comes upon the sky
        </p>

        <p>
            Now I see fire
            <br>
            Inside the mountain
            <br>
            And I see fire
            <br>
            Burning the trees
            <br>
            And I see fire
            <br>
            Hollowing souls
            <br>   
            And I see fire
            <br>
            Blood in the breeze
            <br>
            And I hope that you remember me
        </p>

        <h3>[Verse 3]</h3>
        <p>
            Oh, should my people fall
            <br>
            Then surely I'll do the same
            <br>
            Confined in mountain halls
            <br>
            We got too close to the flame
        </p>
        <p>
            Calling out father oh
            <br>
            Hold fast and we will
            <br>
            Watch the flames burn auburn on
            <br>
            The mountain side
            <br>
            Desolation comes upon the sky

        <h3>[Chorus]</h3>
        <p>
            Now I see fire
            <br>
            Inside the mountain
            <br>
            And I see fire
            <br>
            Burning the trees
            <br>
            And I see fire
            <br>
            Hollowing souls
            <br>
            And I see fire

        <p>
            And if the night is burning
            <br>
            I will cover my eyes
            <br>
            For if the dark returns
            <br>
            Then my brothers will die
            <br>
            And as the sky is falling down
            <br>
            It crashed into this lonely town
            <br>
            And with that shadow upon the ground
            <br>
            I hear my people screaming out
        </p>

            Blood in the breeze

            I see fire
            <br>
            Oh you know I saw a city burning out (fire)
            <br>
            And I see fire
            <br>
            Feel the heat upon my skin, yeah (fire)
            <br>
            And I see fire (fire)
        </p>
        <p>
            And I see fire burn on and on the mountain side
